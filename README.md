Cards for Horrible People
=========================
_A crappy tribute to Cards Against Humanity_

Running it
----------
The server defaults to localhost:3002, but you can override it with the `SERVERURL` variable.
You can enable Redux devtools with `DEBUG=true`, and/or some shortcuts for developing the server with `DEBUGSERVER=true`.

```
SERVERURL=127.0.0.1:3002 node index
```
