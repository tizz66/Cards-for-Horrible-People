react-redux-webpack
=====================

A basic hot-reloading dev environment I'll be using as I start to explore React+Redux.

### Usage

```
npm install
DEBUG=true npm start
open http://localhost:3001
```

src/containers/App.js is the setup for redux; replace SampleApp. redux-devtools is used when DEBUG is true.
